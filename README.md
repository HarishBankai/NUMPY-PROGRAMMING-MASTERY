# 📚 Master NumPy for Data Analysis - Coursework

## 📝 About This Repository
This repository contains my code implementations, practice exercises, and notes from the **"Master NumPy for Data Analysis"** course. 

The goal of this project is to document my learning journey in Python-based scientific computing and to serve as a reference for efficient data manipulation techniques.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Implemented
I have written code covering the following topics:
* **Array Manipulation:** Creation, reshaping, and data types (dtypes).
* **Vectorization:** Optimizing performance by replacing loops with array operations.
* **Broadcasting:** Handling operations between arrays of distinct shapes.
* **Indexing & Slicing:** Boolean masking and fancy indexing for data extraction.
* **Statistical Computing:** Aggregations, sorting, and linear algebra applications.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Language:** Python 3.14.2
* **Library:** NumPy
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

*Note: This repository is for educational purposes and demonstrates my personal understanding of the course material.*
